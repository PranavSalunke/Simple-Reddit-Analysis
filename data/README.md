This data was scraped using the code from commit `2f2126f01cd83ca98f93132f9843be24cdcb802c`. Though it should work the same at the latest commit as well. All data here is clean except the one that is called `uncleanData_6minPopularStream.csv`. That one is there in order for you to observe how analize.py cleans data 



Note: all this data was scraped using my scripts in the parent folder. I have not screened any for the contents of the titles.
