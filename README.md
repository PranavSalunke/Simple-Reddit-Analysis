# Reddit Scraping 

This started as a side project but became a presentation for my web scraping and data mining course.
I mean to share this with everyone anyway, but now that it had become a class presentation, I was forced to "finish" it. 
There is always more that can be done, but this is the "final" product for now.

There are two parts to this project: scraping Reddit and analyzing the data that was gathered. 


**Why did I begin this project?**


[Reddit](reddit.com) is a widely used website that I spend a lot of time on. 

There are millions of people worldwide that use Reddit all through out the day. I began to have a couple questions.

This is some of the stuff I wanted to learn:
* When the most posts were made
* Which subreddits gets the most posts
* Which users post the most often
* If there are many reposts? (same title posted multiple times) 
* What amount of Karma (Reddit points) do users have
